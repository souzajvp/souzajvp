### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a microbiology background and I'm a Ph.D. candidate at State University of MaringÃ¡. My thesis is on "computational approaches to handle Tuberculosis" and I work with drug design and machine learning. In addition to my thesis, I am venturing more into data science, working with global health at the Global Emergency Medicine Innovation & Implementation Research Lab (Duke University).
